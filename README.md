# C++ Todo List Console Application
This is a console-based todo list application written in C++. The application allows the user to create, modify, and delete todo items, and mark them as done or not done. The todo list is displayed in the console, and the user can navigate through the items using the keyboard.

- `e`: edit the selected todo item. (This will enter `EDIT MODE`)

**In EDIT MODE**

- **any other key**: append the key to the editing item.
- `ENTER`: save the editing item (back to NORMAL MODE).

To exit the application, press `q` or `CTRL+C`.
